--TO USE--
Input a series of numbers in X series and Y series. These must be equal in length and must 
be only numbers seperated by a space. Square brackets can be used but are not necessary.

Limits must be 2 numbers seperated by a space. The numbers must be increasing from left to right. Again brackets are optional.

Stylization is simply choose what you want/label what you want.
